# How to Launch the Web App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# Brief for Web App

Aim for the project was to work with the Wikipedia API to randomly select a Premier League footballer and display their: 

* Club history
* Appearances for each club
* Goals for each club
* Empty input field for the user to submit their guess
* The ability to handle a guess and show whether it was correct or not
* After a game has been played, allow user to 'play again' and randomly generate another search
 
# Current State of Web App

# Issues

Although I was able to procure the desired data, the API itself made it very difficult to display the data in a consistent and formatted way. As a result, club names may be presented incorrectly and odd symbols also occassionaly appear.

# Lessons Learned

-[x] Regular Expressions, specifically on how to remove special characters from a string
-[x] String manipulation: .splice, .indexOf, .replace, .includes, .toString
-[x] Building React Functional Components
-[x] Managing states and passing states down to Child Components 
-[x] Mapping prop data in a Child Component
-[x] Never use the Wikipedia API again
