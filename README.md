# Brief for Web App

Aim for the project was to work with the Wikipedia API to randomly select a Premier League footballer and display their: 

* Club history
* Appearances for each club
* Goals for each club
* Empty input field for the user to submit their guess
* The ability to handle a guess and show whether it was correct or not
* After a game has been played, allow user to 'play again' and randomly generate another search
 
# Current State of Web App

* Club history _compelete_
* Appearances for each club _compelete_
* Goals for each club _compelete_
* Empty input field for the user to submit their guess ~~incomplete~~
* The ability to handle a guess and show whether it was correct or not ~~incomplete~~

# Issues

Although I was able to procure the desired data, the API itself made it very difficult to display the data in a consistent and formatted way. As a result, club names may be presented incorrectly and odd symbols also occassionaly appear.
